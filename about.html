                <h2>Biography:</h2>
                <p>My name is Zackery "Sly" Key and I am the writer, designer, and sole developer of the Pirate Harbor website. I was born in Texas, but was raised in a little Arkansas town called Hope. I have been writing code for close to about 2 years now and it has become one of my favorite pastime. I currently live around the Gonzales area in Louisiana. I enjoy watching pirate movies; writing HTML and CSS code; and just strolling down the beach.</p>
                
                <h2>Website Biography:</h2>
                <p>My inspiration for this site is modeled off of my love for the sea. I was raised in the State of Arkansas far from the ocean and I remember the first time I saw the sea, I felt so relaxed and at peace. The water was so soothing and the smell of salt in the air made me feel like I was in a whole new land. I took this same love and devotion when I built Pirate Harbor. I tried to capture the ocean in the background and give a salty ship feel in the banner at the top of the page. My main hope is that I was able to capture the elements of the sea as well as the ship's that used to sail on them.</p>
